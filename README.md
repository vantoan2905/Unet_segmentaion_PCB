# U-Net Segmentation on PCBs

This project uses the U-Net model for segmentation tasks on printed circuit boards (PCBs).

## Overview

The U-Net model is a convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation. This project adapts U-Net for segmenting PCBs, helping to identify and classify components, traces, or defects efficiently.
